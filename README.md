# windTunnelTurbulenceAnalysis
Matlab file used to analyze a specific set of data from a wind tunnel experiment. The data represents the downstream velocity of a turbulent flow at ambient pressure.

In the analysis, Taylor's Hypothesis is assume to be valid. The autocorrelation of the velocity is calculated and the autocorrelation length is obtained.

The energy spectrum of the flow is also analyzed and is then used to investigate the different ranges of the energy spectrum and length scales.

Moreoever, the statisitcs of the velocity increments are also investigated. It is demonstrated as the velocity increment increases, the probability density function (PDF) of the increment approaches a Gaussian distribution. The flatness of the velocity increments is also examined, showing a limit of 3, which agrees witht the PDF distribution results.
